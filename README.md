# Tree Data Structures: Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, and AVL Tree

This repository contains Python implementations of three foundational tree data structures: the **Basic Binary Search Tree (BST)**, **Red-Black Tree**, and **AVL Tree**. Each tree is implemented with integer keys and supports key operations, including insertion, deletion, and search.

## Overview

Tree data structures are essential in computer science for efficient data storage, retrieval, and organization. Each of the trees in this repository serves a specific purpose:

1. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: A straightforward binary tree without enforced balancing, allowing for simple insertion, deletion, and search operations.
2. **Red-Black Tree**: A self-balancing binary search tree that maintains balance using color properties, ensuring efficient worst-case operations.
3. **AVL Tree**: Another self-balancing binary search tree, maintaining balance based on node heights to optimize for search, insertion, and deletion.

## Features

- **Basic Binary Search Tree (BST)**
  - Unbalanced binary tree with simple insert, delete, and search functions.
  - Traversals: In-order, Pre-order, and Post-order (can be added for testing).

- **Red-Black Tree**
  - Implements insertion, deletion, and search with balancing through color properties.
  - Uses rotations and color changes to maintain the Red-Black properties.

- **AVL Tree**
  - Implements insertion, deletion, and search with height-based balancing.
  - Ensures tree height is always within a logarithmic factor of the number of nodes for optimized operations.
